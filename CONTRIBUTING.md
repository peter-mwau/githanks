```

**Types:**

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

**Examples:**

```
feat(search): add hybrid search functionality
fix(api): handle GitHub API rate limiting
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define proper interfaces and types
